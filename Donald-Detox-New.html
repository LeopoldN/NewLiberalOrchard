            <h2 class="main-article-card">Why am I reading this article?</h2>
            <p class="articletext main-article-card"> As we approach election day there is a recurring statement amongst Trump supporters and even a few independents that "no matter how you feel about him the economy was better under Trump."
              If you know me, you know that above all else I hate vibe based beliefs and won't believe something or ignore a fact just so that it will fit my core beliefs. Eventually you just need to admit that data can be reality. 
              So, I decided to go over main talking points by Trump and his supporters to find out for myself, am I being intentionally obtuse or are they living in a world of make believe where their perception of the economy is entirely based on vibes and tweets.
              And hopefully I can convince a fraction people who are "holding their nose and voting for the economy" that maybe they aren't actually voting for the economy... <br/><br/>
              <b>Should be noted that when comparing/appraising Trump's economy, we're going to play fair and ignore the effects of Covid-19, focusing on the first 3 years of his presidency. The flip side of this is that we will be using the last 3 years of Obama's presidency as a base to compare him to. This makes sense, we want to avoid Covid's effects on Biden's presidency and look at how the (small amount of) policy Trump passed changed the economy handed to him. (No real major legislation passed Obama's last 3 years to effect Trump's term.)</b>

              Debt. Ever since Trump came down the Escalator in New York to announce his campaign, he has stated that the debt issue can be easily solved, and that <b>ONLY</b> he can solve it in a manner of months when president. Obviously that didn't happen 
              and while he continues to claim he can do it, the opposite has been happening. Let's look at total US debt over the years and it's ratio to US GDP.

            <p class="articletext"> 
              Now the reason we start with debt, besides the fact that Trump lied about decreasing it, is because I want to use it as one of the main ways we compare Trump to Obama and because it provides a nice cost comparison between the two.
              As you all can clearly see, under Obama's last three years (this is what we will be using as standard for the rest of the article) total US debt increased $2.245 Trillion meanwhile debt to GDP rose from 102.35% to 102.94%. What does this mean?
              Yes, debt increased $748 billion a year but our economy grew around the same amount each year, which is a silver lining. Spending beyond your means will eventually catch up to you regardless of how much of a superpower you are, but in the short term
              it's not as much of a problem as long as your output is increasing as well. It's similar to a family spending more as their disposable income increases, are they really better off? Maybe not, but at least they're not underwater. Under the Trump administration?
              Debt increased $3.377 trillion (in his first three years) or $1.125 Trillion every year, and the debt to GDP ratio? 102.94% to 106.89%. <br/><br/> <b>THIS IS IMPORANT.</b> Trump's tax cuts were justified by conservatives by arguing that economic growth spurred from lower taxes would result in increased
              revenues and that Trump's tariffs would raise government revenues. What actually happened? We <b>obviously</b> spent more and looking at the debt to GDP ratio we <b>DID NOT GROW MORE THAN OUR DEBT</b>. Now I can go on about this for hours, but I shouldn't need to and thats the problem.
              No, lower taxes do not magically reduce deficits (it can depending on how high the taxes are) and tariffs hurt our economic growth significantly more than they raise revenue. <br/><br/> <b>KEEP THIS IN MIND</b> when Trump says he wants to add 100-200% universal tariffs and cut the 
              income tax to zero. No, this will not save the United States, it will cost us millions of jobs on NET, it will raise prices way more than anyone has seen under Biden, it will crowd out investment funding that would normally go to more efficient and advanced manufacturing, cut real wages,
              lower economic growth, and raise the debt levels. Please stop following this lie that we'll be better off under a no income tax and full tariff economic regime- it will be a disaster for you and your family.

            <p class="articletext">
              Of course after looking at the raw amount of debt it's important to look at Tax Revenue, Expenditures, and the Deficit. The deficit chart above tells us pretty much the same thing as before, under Obama the deficit stayed relatively the same, and when compared to GDP, it actually shrunk! 
              And under Trump it continued to increase every year, with the deficit to GDP increasing a significant amount. <br/><br/> Now below you'll see a Revenue and Expenditures chart. Let me explain what's happening there as well. Under Obama's last 3 years, revenues raised $222 billion and the 
              deficit $381 billion, this follows the deficit chart above in that there was little movement during the Obama administration's last 3 years. Meanwhile Trump's administration gets interesting, we see a temporary raise in revenues due to companies front loading their tax payments in 2017 before 
              2018 when the TCJA kicked in. Why is that? Because there were certain deductions and benefits in the old tax code that businesses liked and were being removed under the bill, therefore businesses would have rather <b>paid their taxes before the enactment than after.</b> This of course is just an interesting
              fact to think about, because most people just assumed businesses would have preferred to wait until after and pay a lower tax rate- but sometimes things aren't as simple as one tax rate. Anyways I digress, under Trump tax revenues actually raised faster than under Obama at around $303 billion.
              With Trump's tariffs in play and the TCJA being passed I looked at the Congressional Budget Office to see what exactly changed revenue wise during his first 3 Years.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that there are slight differences between the revenue figures reported by the CBO and the data shown in my chart. This discrepancy likely arises because the CBO report is from 2017, whereas the FRED data I’m using is as up-to-date as possible. Additionally, the CBO may employ different accounting methods and may exclude certain types of revenue from their calculations.
              <br/><br/> Nonetheless, using their data, income tax revenue increased $131 billion, payroll revenue $81 billion, 
              corporate income revenue decreased -$67 billion, all "other taxes" only increased $1 billion. As you can see this leaves out other revenue streams but most importantly it shows that Tariff revenue increased $15 billion dollars. It's safe to say that even with the tax cuts, income and payroll taxes made up a majority of the 
              revenue raised during Trump's office, and that tariffs are not a big help. <b>This is important,</b> when Trump says he wants to cut income taxes and raise Tariffs, this <b>WON'T</b> magically save us and give you more money, it will increase our deficit even more than he has over his first Term.<br/><br/>
              I don't think I need to go over the expenditures chart, you can look at it and it's more the same. Under Obama there was less spending, under Trump? Significantly more spending, considering he barely passed any legislation.

            <br/><br/>
            <p class="articletext">
              Simple and obvious answer? No. The graph says it all. Under the Trump administration, the decrease in our trade deficit slowed and after his first 3 years was almost even. If we're grading Trump based on what he claimed to do, he failed- like with almost every policy promise. But if we grade him on a scale like Republicans do and pretend
              like he should be dealt with like a child and not the president of the United states, then he did okay. He raised tariffs, costing American citizens and businesses money, famously halting the multi year downtrend in washing machine prices and raising costs for consumers to protect a few thousand jobs (not a worth while investment), which
              resulted in the trade deficit only increasing by $32 billion. It would be much cheaper for the US as a whole if we spent half that time and money investing in new manufacturing and jobs programs in dying areas, then propping up inefficent, dying businesses because we think Americans shouldn't lose washing machine 
              factories. I don't know but for some reason I feel like I'd much rather have the US transition the washing machine plant into high tech manufacturing like batteries, solar, or other new growing industries (as Biden has in the CHIPS and IRA bills) than protect trash based on vibes and sentiment- but thats just me.

            <p class="articletext">
              Here comes my favorite part, let's look at real Median household income and the CPI. Real means it takes inflation into account and Median means it's the middle earners in the country and won't be influenced by really rich people raising the overall salary. For the middle American family, their real income rose 11% under Obama adding $7,500
              more to their pocketbook. Pretty good for a president that passed almost no major legislation for stimulus, infrastructure, or taxes.<br/><br/> Now let's compare Donald, who, as you know claimed to have created the best economy ever, passed a huge tax cut in his first year to stimulate the economy, and ran up record deficits during his tenure. <b>6 . 3 5 %</b>
              after ALL that yapping and yelling about the greatest economy in US history and how much better everyone was than under OBUMMER, Trump raised real median wages $5000 <b>HALF THE PERCENTAGE AND $2500 LOWER THAN OBAMA</b>. What most people experienced under Trump was a VIBE shift, because they were told that everything was doing amazing, they believed it- but 
              in reality they were doing worse off than they were under Obama, <b>AND THE US WAS IN EVEN WORSE FINANCIAL SHAPE</b>. It's absolutely atronomically stupid that we continue to pretend like things were sooooo much better under Trump when they empirically werent. The idea that Trump was magically the greatest economic mirical to happen <b>IS A LIE.</b> <br/><br/>
              We can also do something even more fun. For every dollar that real median wages increased in the US, how much did the federal government spend over what it did during the Obama administration? $226,400,000 is how much more the US spent <b>per $1 in real wage increase</b>. Businessman doing business things or something...

            <p class="articletext">
              Another masterclass from the Trump playbook is to claim that inflation was so much better than it has ever been under his administartion. Is that True? The guy who had the Federal Reserve raising rates out of fear of inflation, pumped stimulus into an already good economy, and threw up inflationary tariffs had the best inflation EVER? Let's look at the CPI data.
              <br/><br/>For those who don't know the CPI is a weighted basket of goods from energy to food and everything in between that an average family may consume over the course of the year. The government also does massive surveys where they check on these prices around the country to get an accurate average for each item. The biggest critique of the CPI is not that it's 
              made up government numbers to fit the presidents agenda like a few people claim, but that it's a national average, which doesn't work perfectly when the country is as big and numerous as the United States. Nonetheless, it's the best measure we have, so im using it. Under Obama's last 3 years? CPI grew 3.5%. Under Trump? 6.42%. Tell me again who kept championing how much better his economy was.
              <b>Let me make this clear.</b> Under Obama we saw better real wage growth, lower inflation, and less money spent- but for some reason we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump, the convicted rapist and felon, who has gone through 40+ cabinet members, and talks like a 5 year old at recess is supposed to be the best thing thats ever happend to us?

              I mean does this chart even need an explanation? Im not gonna write out the numbers it's so obvious you can hover of it and read it. This is real investment so inflation isn't the main driver under Biden. What is the point of this? Like I've repeated a million times, Trump is entirely all talk and no action. For year this man has said he will invest and bring back manufacturing! He didn't do it
              and if anything it's death got worse under him even as he ruined our competitiveness with Tariffs. Meanwhile, a man who was called old, crooked, sleepy, incompetant, and devisive (lol) was able to nearly double real manufacturing investment within the United States <b>WITH A DIVIDED CONGRESS.</b> Why is it that democratic candidates have been able to work with and pass 
              critical legislation during a divided congresses constantly, but with a GOP trifecta in his first 2 years Donald got nothing done and became a muppet that signed execute orders in the second half of his presidency. <br/><br/> I thought we judged people on what they got done, not by what Fox and other news media tells you got done. What has become of the GOP when
              their standard for what is good hinges solely on whether their guy greenlights it in a tweet. You can't spend your life in delusion- you have to wake up eventually.

              What more fun than manufacturing? GDP naturally... Honestly I'm surprised I didn't put this further up, but there's so much that needs to be talked about that this isn't nearly as important. The chart above is real GDP per capita, therefore inflation and the number of workers in the economy wont affect this number. Let's get to it, per person the US economy grew 5.59% in real terms under Obama.
              And now Donald? <b>Only 4.91%.</b> At this point you may just find this annoying, why is he just doing the same thing over and over again. It's because this is a DETOX. People need to realize this self-described genius is nothing more than a snake oil salesman that somehow pumped the economy full of liquid heroine and still did worse than Mr. Sobriety beforehand. Before we go to employment which
              will get even worse, let's just remind ourselves we spend over $3.3 trillion dollars for worse results. If Trump was working under Tony Soprano he'd be kneeless by now.

            <h2 class="main-article-card">The Employment Myth</h2>

            <div class="main-article-card">
            <p class="articletext">
              Before we talk about Unemployment we need to lay down some facts for people who don't know much about these figures and how they're calculated. The U-3 unemployment rate is the official rate that you hear reported by the White House and News Agencies, and it gets flack by both sides whenever it fits their narrative. The main problem people have with it is that it shows the ratio between those employed
              and those who are included in the labor force. Where labor force is the primary point of contention as it only accounts for individuals who are either employed or actively seeking work. As a result, people who have stopped looking for work due to various reasons, such as the lack of suitable job opportunities, aren't included. In general this is a reasonably effective metric and is a reliable gauge for the economy, but to counter act people whining about it in this article,
              we will include just the raw employment level as well as Prime Age Labor Force Participation. Labor force participation rate is simple, they take the number of employed people and divide it by the total number of working age people. This removes the fear caused by U-3. On the other hand Prime Age restricts this number of people to those aged 25-54 in order to avoid biases caused by students in Highschool and College as well as
              those nearing retirement or in early retirement.<br/><br/>Employment is Trump's biggest talking point and it's probably one of the only metrics he fares well in. When looking at the U-3 Rate he does significantly worse than Obama, although that's less because of Trump being bad and more of Obama benefiting from starting at a higher unemployment rate due to the Great Recession. 
              <br/><br/>This shows when looking at prime age LFPR, as Obama's had stayed relatively the same, while Trump actually saw more people entering into the labor force while still observing U-3 decrease. What I would like to focus on is total employment.
              <br/><br/>Under Obama employment rose 4.8% adding 7 million news jobs before Trump became president. In the next 3 years it grew 4.16% adding 6.3 million jobs, this is great all things considered especially since we had a labor shortage (could do with a bit of immigration). But again, let's look at the additional cost we accrued for those jobs. Trump added $3.377 Trillion to the debt and boasts about 6.3 million new jobs. That equates to about $536,031 per job created. Compare that to Obama, $320,714 per job created...
              <b>Donald Trump's economy was vibes built on stimulus and debt, and will catch up fast if he continues with his stated goals.</b>

            <p class="articletext">
              We're now pivoting away from more hard data and towards my subjective opinion. I want to first start off by stating that most if not all economists
              and even finance bros on Wall Street will agree that strong institutions and checks and balances are integral for not only our democracy but also economic growth. Politicians already suck at controlling spending, why would
              you want to put them in charge of controlling our monetary policy as well? The Federal Reserve is likely one of the most important institutions in the United States on par with the Supreme Court, but the decisions they
              make are significantly more impactful to everyday Americans. The point is that good long term policy aimed at stable prices and maximum employment can only be achieved when people are insulated from political pressure (look
              at Paul Volcker and his rate hikes in the late 70s that stopped hyperinflation).
              <br/><br/>Therefore, when the Federal reserve raised rates in the second half of 2016 and leading into the Trump administration they were making the right decision. Rates had been low for too long and the economy was recovering,
              I mean look at the data I just showed you - Obama's economy had low inflation and robust growth. Trump then added fuel to an already strong fire and stimulated the economy, which led to the Fed making the, again, correct decision 
              to raise rates even more. Inflation was slightly higher and the labor shortage plus tariffs were threatening to raise it even further. Raising rates during the Trump administration was proven to be an even better decision once Covid-19
              came into the picture and we were able to lower them back to zero. This is infinitely better than if we had entered into Covid with zero rates and we needed to go negative.
              <br/><br/>The reason I bring up the Federal Reserve is because of Trump's disgusting lack of respect for it as an institution, and his authoritarian desire to control and put political pressure on Jerome Powell to lower rates for his own
              benefit. <b>America was not founded on the ideals that one man should have dictatorial powers over anything he wants to.</b>

            I'm gonna end this on one simple message, he doesn't actually get anything done. Think to yourself, how many things has he actually passed or accomplished. The Tax and Jobs Act? That's his one and only legislative accomplishment, and it wasn't even his bill.
            Immigration? 9 Years later nothing changed. Infrastructure? Where's his bill. Health Plan? He has concepts of a plan. I mean read his website or the GOP platform, they don't even talk about policy anymore. Their whole platform is we hate transkids, we want to 
            deport millions of people, and put tariffs on everything. <b>If we end Trump populism, we can finally have a normal right wing opposition party that doesn't lose and whine about it</b>
