            <!-- GDP -->

            <p class="articletext w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">
                Woah woah woah welcome back sleepy Joe, it's been a while. Over a year since our last post actually, so lets get you up to date on what has happened. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">GDP</h2>
            <p class="articletext">
            Our favorite figure, GDP forecasts, released last thurdsay and the advanced estimate blew our minds. The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2023, according to the <a class="article-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2023-advance-estimate">Bureau of Economic Analysis'</a> third estimate. If we take the Atlanta Fed's GDPNowcast with a grain of salt, with their projected 3.5% growth in Q3, then 2023 is looking like an incredible year for Joe Biden. 
            <br><br>

            The forcasted growth was primarily due to increased consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, private inventory investment, and federal spending, which were partly offset by lower exports and residential fixed investment. Imports decreased.
            </p> 
            <div class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">

            </div>
            <p class="articletext">
            Other key features one may want to focus on are an increase in real disposable personal income of 2.5% and an increase in the personal savings rate from 4.3% in Q1 to 4.4% in Q2.
            </p>

            <!-- Inflation -->
          
            <h2 class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom w3-border-bottom">Inflation</h2>
            <p class="articletext">
            IMPORTANT NOTE: while this is the July 2023 report, inflation data for the current month won't be released until next month. Therefore, we will be viewing the June 2023 inflation report. July's data will be available in August's release.<br><br>
            Now, continuing the great news, the U.S. Consumer Price Index saw a light rise of 0.2 percent month over month, following a 0.1 percent increase in May, according to the <a class="article-link" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230730000129/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Comparing June 2022, we saw a year on year growth of 3 percent. It should be noted that June of 2022 is when inflation peaked in the US, and we have only seen progress since.
            </p>
            <div class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">
            <iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=17tCC&width=650vh&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:100%; height:525px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="articletext">
            Core CPI (All items minus Energy and Food) rose on pace with All Items at 0.2 percent this month compared to last month and 4.8 percent compared to last June. While the Fed does not target core CPI with it's monetary policy, it is still a good sign that we could be experiencing a very rare soft landing (a reduction in inflation through rate hikes that does not coincide with high unemployment).
            </p>
          
            <!-- Debt/Savings -->
          
            <h2 class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom w3-border-bottom">Consumer Debt to Savings</h2>
            <p class="articletext">
              As always we want to focus on a common talking point amongst Republicans, which is that while our economic numbers look good, they are overshadowed by the massive amounts of debt Americans are taking on. If you are a recurring reader (we love you), then you are familiar with the charts below. They are usually used by Trump Supporters or FJB Truck drivers to exagerate how much America is suffering under debt,
            </p>

            <p class="articletext">
              We don't want this to get old, but this really needs to be stated, while this looks horrendous, it's not. Sure, the Personal Savings rate is near all time lows and consumer credit card debt has been on a tear, but no one should be looking at these numbers by themselves. What business or investor just looks at the debt of a company? To put this into proper context, we should view it as a ratio of debt payments to disposable income. And... well the numbers speak for themselves,      
            </p>
            <div class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">

            </div>
            <p class="articletext">
              While these are still Q1 numbers, American's are not en masse drowning in debt.
            </p>

            <!-- Jobs -->
          
            <h2 class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom w3-border-bottom">JOBS JOBS JOBS!</h2>
            <p class="articletext">
              Just like last month and the month before that, and the month before that... America does NOT have a employment problem. The <a class="article-link" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230730033035/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported that total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 209,000 in June, while the unemployment rate remained little changed at 3.6 percent. Is the unemployment rate the lowest it is in history? No. But we have seen rates rise as high as 4 percent in the recent years and we have seen inflation lower and unemployment stay low. This is undoubtably a win for the Biden Administration.<br><br>
              Now for the abligatory "no, these jobs are not just returning from Covid (that was 3 years ago now)." As you can see in the chart below industry level employment has changed. This is not just people returning to their jobs. Agriculture is down 100k below precovid and Hospitality/Leisure are 400k below precovid. Meanwhile, Manufacturing is 200k above precovid and Finance is 300k above precovid. Obviously this is not people returning to work but shifting entire industries.
            </p>
            <div class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">
            <iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=17tH2&width=650vh&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:100%; height:525px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="articletext">
              Secondly, when looking at the total number of employed people and the Prime Age Laborforce Participation Rate, we have still seen growth from the pre-pandemic highs. 
            </p>
            <div class="w3-margin-top w3-margin-bottom">
            <iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=17tHj&width=650vh&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:100%; height:525px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" loading="lazy"></iframe>

            </div>    
            <p class="articletext">
              Total employment is now a little above 4 million higher than it was pre-pandemic. If we only count those numbers as jobs Biden "created," he oversaw 133k new jobs every month since he took office. Thats good. <br><br>
              The last time Prime-Age Laborforce Participation (LFPR) was higher than today was 22 years ago. The economy is doing fine, and you can give Biden credit for continuing to oversee an economic expansion rather than try to discredit it.

              Our favorite section about macro-level data that we find interesting or that was being discussed widely during the last month. During July, sadly there has not been a lot of interesting data to point out. Although US Homeownership in the US is at 66 percent, which runs contradictory to the belief that Americans are just at the mercy of landlords.
